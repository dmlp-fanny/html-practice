        <h1>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the difference between the usage of <strong>HTML and CSS?</strong></li>
            <p>HTML is used to create structure of the webpage and CSS helps adding a style the webpage. HTML can be found in the files with .html ending. CSS on the other hand can be part of .html files or be in totally separate file with .css ending. </p>
            
            <li>What is the newest version of <strong>HTML?</strong></li>
            
            <p>The newest version is HTML5.</p>
            
            <li>What are the top five most used <strong>HTML5 elements</strong>? If not sure, make a guess.</li>
            
            <p>These answers were found on this following page dedicated to HTML: <a href="https://html.com/html5/#What_is_HTML5" target="_blank">html.com</a></p>
                    <ul>
                        
                            <li>Encouraging semantic (meaningful) markup</li>
                            <li>Separating design from content</li>
                            <li>Promoting accessibility and design responsiveness</li>
                            <li>Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>

                    </ul>
            <li>Have you checked out the <strong>HTML5 cheatsheet?</strong></li>
            
            <p>Only a glance, as it is very comprehensive list. The cheatsheet can be found: <a href="https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            
            <li>What is the difference between <strong>semantic and non-semantic</strong> elements?</li>
            
            <p>Semantic elements are those that have clearly defined their purpose in their name. Non-semantic elements are usually more neutral, for example &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;.</p>
            
            <li>Why do we prefer using <strong>semantic elements?</strong></li>
            
            <p>It can add clarity and streamline the code. </p>
            
            <li>Do all <strong>browsers support</strong> all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?</li>
            
            <p>Mostly yes. There could be some differences that can be tested on the page: <a href="https://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Can I Use</a>.</p>
            
            <li>
                Test the following elements on <a href="https://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Can I Use</a>: svg, nav, code, form, datalist. Which browser version supports them and which do not?
            </li>

            <p>Those in green fields are supported browers for each element. The red means it is not supported (for example: form is not supported in Internet Explorer). And grey means there is no data about it.</p>
        </ol>
